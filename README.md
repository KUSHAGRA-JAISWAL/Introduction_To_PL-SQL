PL/SQL is a block of codes that used to write the entire program blocks/ procedure/ function, etc. It is declarative, that defines what needs to be done, rather than how things need to be done. PL/SQL is procedural that defines how the things needs to be done. Execute as a single statement.<br><br>
This repository is the collection of PL-SQL Programs that has been done While Learning PL-SQL.<br><br>

<h2><b>NOTE<b>:- All the Notes are Included inside the Programs. </h2>
<br>
This repo has divided into one main categories that covers:-<br>

⚫<u>Learning Sections</u>:- This section contains all the programs that will help you to understand all the Basic and some advance Concepts of PL-SQL. <br>

## ⭐Compilation <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bk962Bi.gif" height=30px>

 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aLhRk4Z.gif" height=12px>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>( g++ program_name.cpp ):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> This will compile your program at the same location with the name a.out / a.exe .<br>

 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aLhRk4Z.gif" height=12px>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>( g++ program_name.cpp -o xyz ):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> This will compile your program at the same place but if you use -0 it will give a custom name to your compiled program, in this case it is xyz. <br>

 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aLhRk4Z.gif" height=12px>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>( g++ program_name.cpp -o ../../out/xyz ):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> This will compile your program at the location where you want to save with the name you want, in my case it is xyz.<br>

 ## ⭐Run<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZTeqcGO.gif" height=35px>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aLhRk4Z.gif" height=12px>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>( program_name.exe ):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Writting this at the location where your program is compiled, it will run your C++ program. -->
